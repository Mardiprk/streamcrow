📜 StreamCrow: Milestone-Based Escrow on Solana
🚀 Overview

StreamCrow is a milestone-based escrow smart contract built on Solana using the Anchor framework.
Unlike traditional escrow (all-or-nothing), StreamCrow allows funds to be released progressively as milestones are completed and approved.

This makes it perfect for:

Freelance payments 💻

Service contracts 📑

DAO-funded projects 🏗️

Subscription-like agreements 🔁

✨ Key Features

Milestone-based payouts: Funds are released in stages, not all at once.

Trustless fund holding: Escrow funds are stored in a PDA vault owned by the program.

Dispute resolution: Either party can raise disputes, resolved by an arbiter.

Fair splitting: Arbiter can split funds between client & provider during disputes.

Token-agnostic: Works with any SPL token (e.g., USDC, USDT, custom tokens).

🧩 Workflow

Client creates escrow

Defines milestones & funds escrow with tokens.

Provider submits milestone

Marks work as submitted.

Client approves milestone

Approves milestone → funds released to provider.

Dispute handling

Either party can raise a dispute.

Arbiter resolves and splits funds fairly.
